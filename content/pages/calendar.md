### Anarchy and activism

Hip Hop has long been figured as the "CNN of the Streets," able to incite action and progressive change. But gangsta strains of hip hop seem to incite anarchy as much as activism. Are activism and anarchy two sides of the same coin? Can they be successfully combined in popular music for progressive social action?

Is misogyny inevitable in the construction of popular culture? Is misogyny inseparable from hip hop? Alternately, how can hip hop be enabled to empower women?

In-class: performance workshop with Nappy Grooves, an all drag-kings of color group. Founded by Nia Hamilton, Mattie Richardson and three other Bay Area residents in 2004 and based in Oakland, Calif., Nappy Grooves was formed to give black drag kings an opportunity to perform. Richardson was previously a member of the Disposable Boy Toys, a predominantly white drag king troupe, and said she grew tired of only being invited to perform skits on affirmative action. The troupe, dedicated to fun, sexy, anti-racist, feminist gender performance, features Bill Dagger, Corn Bread, and Tyrone Peaches (aka Nepharious Vulvaleen). They have performed a variety of genders and sexualities for audiences across California and New York. Richardson and Hamilton have provided tutorials on becoming drag kings, applying facial hair and assuming a masculine stride while physically evolving into Bill Dagger and Tyrone Peaches, their respective male characters. Richardson described Dagger as a womanizer who is closeted about his attraction to men, while Hamilton depicted Peaches as a questioning jock. Both said their characters reflect gender personalities or stereotypes within the African-American community. Richardson said her particular interest is "making commentary on black masculinities by placing them at odds with each other."
